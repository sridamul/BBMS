# BBMS
Overview...
This is a mini project on the concept of Book Bank Management System.
I have built this project within hours. So, I don't have any proper code refactoring.
The main challenge is to build this project's frontend using python(Tkinter GUI package). So, I used firebase's real time database as the backend so that it would be ease to store and retrieve data easily from anywhere.
I have used APIs such as twilio sms api, google books api and new.org api to enhance the application.
I am trying to refactor this code in a better way so that everyone can understand.I encourage the develeopers to edit my code as a neat and understandable one which might help many individual developers.
